This project free of charge, but it remains my property, so please mention the author when using the files. Thanks !!

I tought it would be nice to have a cnc spindle engraver using the same assembly as the laser cutter/engraver with minimal changes,

so here it is ... (STL CAD files and images)


NOTE:
The Mks DLC32 in the laser project can control the Z axis stepper but you need another driver with heat sink

The MKS LC32 can be converted to Laser or Spindle by issuing a serial command

I am going to use a arduino nano with a button connected to the MKS DLC32 to issue that command and easly switch between laser and spindle (more details soon)
