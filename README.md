This project is share free of charge.
I tought it would be nice to have a cnc spindle engraver using the same build as the laser cutter/engraver with minimal changes, so here it is

List of materials:

3d printed parts in the REPO - Printed All at 0.16mm layer with 20% infill (gyroids) 5 walls and tops on PLA+CF, but PLA is also fine, I guess
The Spindle Cover is optional

1 x NEM17 type motor
1 x Coupler to connect the 8mm threaded rod to the motor
1 x 8mm threaded Rod
2 x 8mm guide rods
4 x hexagonal brass spacers for the motor
6 cilindrical neodymium magnets (5mm diameter) for securing the cover
Heat Insert threaded nuts for 3d printing - M3 and M4
2 8mm threaded nuts (one stripped of the inner grooves to act as guide fo rthe threaded rod bottom)
2 bushings for the 8mm rods
Screws and nuts used for the Mokey laser project are the same used in this adapter.
silicone or rubber 2mm thick, 150 mm wide for better securing the spindle (can be other material)
super glue and/or epoxi
The Mks DLC32 can control the Z axis stepper but you need another driver with heat sink

NOTE:
The LC32 can be converted to Laser or Spindle by issuing a command
I am going to use a nano board with a button connevted to the MKS DLC32 to issue that command and easly switch between laser and spindle (more details soon)
