I tought it would be nice to have a cnc spindle engraver using the same build as the laser cutter/engraver with minimal changes, so here it is

The Mks DLC32 can control the Z axis stepper but you need another driver with heat sink

NOTE:
The LC32 can be converted to Laser or Spindle by issuing a command
I am going to use a nano board with a button connevted to the MKS DLC32 to issue that command and easly switch between laser and spindle (more details soon)
